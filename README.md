## What is PiSignage? 

PiSignage is a HD video capable Digital Signage Player based on standard and off-the-shelf 
components. It connects to TV via HDMI port and is powered from any standard USB source (~0.75A). 
It is based on credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer(Model B/B+/pi2) and completely solid-state. 

PiSignage can be managed individually by a Browser(Chrome preferred) or centrally by a Server or using the hosted 
service at pisignage.com. 

**Managing Screens is just a few steps**
 
1. Upload images/videos, provide web or streaming links, design and upload HTML assets as a zip file
2. Create playlists by selecting files, drag and rearrange, select duration. You can select one of the 8 layouts 
    provided for playlist, add a ticker feed and insert contents of playlists in between other playlist(advertisement)
3. Group players, schedule multiple playlists based on time or events and change display settings. Deploy playlists at the 
    click of a button to all the players in the group
4. Get status and reports about player, upgrade software centrally to all players, issue debug commands from the server.
